# Titanic Survival Prediction with Decision Tree

This project applies a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the survival of Titanic passengers using Python. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables
- Model training using scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier
- Model evaluation with accuracy score and confusion matrix

## Dataset

- [`titanic.csv`](titanic.csv): Contains passenger data including class, sex, age, fare, and survival status.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and ensure you have the required libraries:
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    - seaborn
    - scikit-learn

2. Open and run the Jupyter notebook: [`DT_Titanic.ipynb`](DT_Titanic.ipynb)

## Results

- Visualizations of survival rates by gender, class, and age
- Model accuracy and confusion matrix for performance evaluation
